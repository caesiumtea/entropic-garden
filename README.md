# entropic garden ðŸŒ±

This repo contains a [digital garden](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) made with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). At the moment, it's simply a direct mirror of the Markdown files that I edit in Obsidian, but I'm hoping to eventually add a more polished, browsable version.

## how to read

In general, the content of the garden can be found in the `notes` directory. You can of course just skim the list of filenames, click on whichever strike your fancy, and read them as Markdown right here on GitHub. I'm uh, not sure yet whether the internal links will work or not. 

Alternatively, if you have Obsidian installed, I assume it should be possible to download this repo and open it with Obsidian as if it were your own vault? Until I get webpage generation up and running, if you really want to browse this garden with the proper navigation or see the graph view, I think that's gonna be your best bet.
