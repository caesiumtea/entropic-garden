### standard Obsidian shortcuts
*(includes shortcuts from core plugins)* 

1.  `[Ctrl + P]` command palette
2.  `[ / ]` (just a regular slash by itself while editing) inline mini command palette
3.  `[Ctrl + N]` create new note
4.  `[Ctrl + Shift + N]` create new note in new pane
5.  `[Ctrl + E]`  toggle edit mode <-> preview mode
6.  `[Ctrl + O]` open Quick Switcher
7.  `[Ctrl + Shift + F]` search in all notes
8.  `[Ctrl + F]` find in current note
9.  `[Ctrl + Alt + left/right arrows]` navigate back/forward through last pages viewed
10.  `[Ctrl + click]` on a note to open in new pane
11.  `[Ctrl + hover]` over a note or link to preview its contents

- this list started from copying the one in [Nick Milo](nick-milo.md)'s [Obsidian for Beginners: 8 Important Hotkeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDcoBMVJsvk) 
- fwiw, that video mentioned `Ctrl-click` (well, technically, cmd-click) for following a link while in edit mode as one of his top 8 shortcuts, but it seems this only applies to static *"source" edit mode*, and is no longer needed in Live Preview -- in Live Preview edit mode, as of Obsidian version 0.13 at least, just a regular click appears to be sufficient to follow a link.

### my custom shortcuts

1. `[Alt + up/down arrow]` move line up/down (a la VS Code)
2.
