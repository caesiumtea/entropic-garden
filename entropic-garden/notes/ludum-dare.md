## tips
- aim for 2-5 minute playtime
- (modified from https://itch.io/blog/178/get-ready-for-ludum-dare) areas to block out time for working on:
	- design the core mechanics and necessary algorithms 
	- design the general look and graphics
	- code player movement/controls
	- code enemies (or idk whatever else has variable behavior)
	- level/environment
	- menus/UI
	- intro/instructions for player
	- graphics
	- sound
	- writing/story???
	- testing.......
