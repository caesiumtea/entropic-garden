## tips
- aim for 2-5 minute playtime
- (modified from https://itch.io/blog/178/get-ready-for-ludum-dare) areas to block out time for working on:
	- design the core mechanics and necessary algorithms 
	- design the general look and graphics
	- code player movement/controls
	- code enemies (or idk whatever else has variable behavior)
	- level/environment
	- menus/UI
	- intro/instructions for player
	- graphics
	- sound
	- writing/story???
	- testing.......

# brainstorming
THE GOAL: algorithmically/mechanically simple, but thematically unusual and interesting. ideally still wanna make a js game and learn soemthing for it though, not a twine type game, even though some fo thsse ideas may lean more toward a story based applcaiton after all.

-   the cat food game is a cute idea that might be fun to make and can probably be easy enough to implement, but it doesn't really grab me yknow??? its like, it has a cuteness factor that might make someone smile and enjoy it, but there's nothing sufficiently unique about it that would make it worth playing or fill a different niche than the mmillion similar games that exist. it's not a winner. (but we already decded that wining/scoring well wasnt the point??? but, it might be cool....) it's the same thing as the guy we were rolling eyes at on youtube--it's just a totally generic example of its genre (whatvewr that may be lol) er  guess i mean mechanic, dressed up a little to fit a theme but that's all that mkes it erelvenat. its not a good contest entry. and like, maybe that's fine!! since oproginally all we wanted was to use this as a learning oppiruntiy, and it;s a perfectly example for Learning How To Make Games...! but, that's all, and.... i guess now that im already this invested in things, i feel liek we can do better??
-   maybe our best shot at making something that we would feel was worth playing (ie has *unique* value) is through either exploration/discovery mechanics (eg clicker or point-n-click adventure type thing)  or "make a cute thing to screenshot"

## theme brainstorm.. "delay the inevitable"......
-   how do u make it not depressing..... well okay lets start with. why DOES it sound depressing?
-   assumptions!!! we're kind of implicitly reading "the ineveitable" as referring to losing or to failure, right? but that doesnt necessarily have to be the case.  we're also assuming tht the player is the one who is delaying, or that "dealying the inevitable" sopeciufically refers to the action being taken by the player as the main game mechanic, but again, does it HAVE to mean that? what if another game entity is doing the delaying?
-   what if the inevitble is victory? thinkinga bout like, "the arc of (whatver) bends toward jsutice" for instance, or the leguin quote about how like, we curerntly think capitalism seems inevitable and inescapable, but that used to be the way people thought about the divine right of kings too and yet here we are. -- the idea of liberation, justice, equity as inevitable, and the injsutices and obstacles holding us back right now merely temporary setbacks, dealying progress but never stopping it.  .... i dont know HOW the fuck you make that intoa  game lmao but yeah
-   basically the problem with reading it an alternate way is like, how to make it.. gameplay element-y. if what you're workling toward is inevitable, then the game doesnt actually need to be played in order to win or whatever/ doesnt matter whether you play it or not..... conventually speaking,a t least! it brings into question the reason we play games/ the point of playing games, right. like, prompts the quesiton, is the point really jsut to win? if it's not, then what IS the point or value in it? wht makes the journey more than the destination?
-   thinking about nachtigal and how it gave you the option to run away and how fucking good that was to really feel that unfulfillment of being "reasonable" instead of playing along
-   thinking about the  cbt thing of whatver with like "the scoreboard aanlogy" thats what it was lol yeah, being asked "if you just had the vitory handed to you without doing anything, would you be satisfied/ would you still appreicate it?" and hw much i resent it being framed in a way that winks at you to answer no, isntead of letiing you genueinly come to your own conclusoon about what you do or dont value..... a game that just tells you up front, if you do nothing you're still gonna win, and then you get to see for yourself whether that feels good or not, and lets you figure out for yourself what other options re more fun than just winning
-   (oh isnt the 'dont push the button' type game charlie showed us at the mt laurel vacation that kind of thing?)
-   idk if that works as "delaying" though.....    
-   what about like. 'the game is gonna end in 30 seconds, do whatver you want until then' and the core liek player motive is jsut to play and explor--and some of the exporing can increase the time on the countdown so that you have more opportunity left to explore some more, but still, there isnt a win or lose state, winning is jsut defined by your own sense of interest in what you get to discover or not. 
-   (oh like rose's twine game from cmu!!! about getting screwed over if you get too caugh tup int he details and exploration and wondering)
-   LOL OK WELL. that sounds pretty good and all but it's defientiely not soemthing we can quickly make in javascript. maybe we could quickly make it as a twine or renpy or bitsy game but, ehhhh.
-   still!! the good point from that was, delaying just referring to your own subjecrtive experince of wanting the game ot last longer, just for the sake of playing
-   example: gathering fuel for a flickering fire/oil lamp to try ot make the light last as long as possible to see as much of the environemtna s possible
-   relatedly the qureesitonof why i feellike i want to work so hard tm on this compo, why i wanna enter the compo instead of the jam, in almost direct constast--the idea of it jsut being fun to challenge yourself  to something really hard, just to see if you can do it, even going into it knowing youre going to probably fial, but nonetheless being excited about that tiny sliver of a chance to get some kind of recognition or victory, 
-   why do people do things that they expect to fail? why do people play a video game level hundreds and hundreds of times failing voer and over but with the faith that they'll get it eventually? or, why do people care about trying to win anywya?
-   from cooking example below: a pretty good solution about making it not depressing: the inevitable thing isn't the goal of the game but it make lore sense for it to be the intended outcome; you want it to happen, but just not QUITE yet, not until seomtrhing else happens first.  examples of that feeling:  not wanting a good book to end yet; finishing a good meal; if you like your school, graduation; kids growing up or whatver, suppopsedly; 
-   a mechanic about "wait wait wait i wasnt ready yet!!!" - trying to get something set up jsut right when the timer ends, or like, "whatver it looks like when the shutter clicks is your final pciture!" but you can't directly control when that happens, isntead you inderectly try to stall until you can ? accumulate enough good things for the picture ??. --not the best for te theme

on the heavier side.....

-   another way to get really philosphical about it and to ask what value and satsifaciton and meanign we might find in delaying the inevitable is like, the idea of the inevitablity of death, and how we try to extend our lives as much as possible 

#### little ideas.......  
-   i do still wanna jsut learn how to make a clicker, sooooooo.  a clicker where your Number Go Up is always gonna be countered by a strogner Number Go Down?? again, to take a depressing route, this can easily be like a Capitalism Simulator
-   trying to take the perfect photo of the food you cooked before it's all eaten (or rather, since we're delaying here, more like keep people form eating it until the very long shutter timer clicks lol. could be something simialr with lke idkpeople messing up/losing their costumes or makeup or smth but that has less of the direct "inevitable" as in like, the thing you're delaying is in fact the actual literal purpose that you did the thing for in the first place, but you just wanna get a fucking pcitgure first
-   more specific: a very fancy meal prepared for cats (jun's kitchen style), and all these cats are coming at ti tryingto eat it and you gotta shoo them away while the camera timer counts down, then at the end they get to come eat it (alternative could have something to do with making sure all the cats get their fair share)
-   jsut.. something about being a witch makin potions..........  would be cool......
-   colelcting oil to keep your lamp burning to see more of the environemtn
-   something that freezes the final state of the canvas and frames it as a picture, encouraging the player to take a screenshot and to replay the game to make the cutest/best arrangement for that final moment
-   if you still do feel very interested in a word game--how about something where your bank of letters is gradually disappeating/getting eaten, as the thing you're delaying?
-   using magic to keep a day/vacation/etc from ending..???, i guess this could be the potion thingy!! you use your time to gather ingredients to make more delay-time potions, but its imopotant that you also collect something else so that it doesnt feel completely futile or pointless..... every time you go ingrdient hunting (atelier style) theres a random cahnce to find some ssouvenier that adds to your collection? or you get a snapshot/journal entry of some fun experience (e.g. with friends) that you had that day? .... ok ok this sounds really cute actually.!!!! i am.. feeling better about this one than the cat one, maybe, yeah......!!!
